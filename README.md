* Sadly, after a Chinese New Year vocation, I can barely catch up the pace of the previous learning schedule, and browsing the commit history and comments on commit is confusing.

## Commits Specifications RULEs
On the Commit history page, Commit Headline is the straight-forward description of what is committed.
Nothing of the work in detail is displayed unless the Commit headline is clicked.
Commit Extended Description is the concrete details, the shorter the better.


1. Commit Headline is the summary of the modification on the files, for example, fixing the XXX bug, adding XXX chapter
2. Commit Extended Description is the concrete details of why the bug occured and what has been done to fix it, or the main idea of the new chapter (along with the content of following chapter).
